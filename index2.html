            <h3>Todo list</h3>
            <p>A to-do list is a powerful tool for organizing tasks, managing time effectively, and achieving goals. Whether it's for personal productivity or professional project management, a to-do list serves as a central hub where tasks are recorded, tracked, and prioritized.

                At its core, a to-do list is a simple yet versatile concept: it's a list of tasks or activities that need to be completed within a specific timeframe. These tasks can range from everyday chores and errands to complex projects and assignments. By compiling them in one place, individuals can gain a clear overview of what needs to be done and stay focused on their priorities.
